## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


만약 flutter SDK 관련 문제가 생긴다면, 설정 들어가서 flutter 경로가 비어있어서 그럴 확률이 높음. 따라서 터미널에서 명령어 입력해서 flutter sdk 주소를 찾고, 설정에서 입력해주고 "pub get" 해주면 됨
